Third time is a charm! Time to write a working X86 kernel from the ground up!

A wiki has been setup to document Dexter which will be populated over the coming months. There isn't a lot of information posted yet. You can find build instructions, project goals, and other information on the wiki. but its usefulness at the moment is quite limited. You can find the wiki at https://www.dexterwiki.com.

There are no grand plans for Dexter at the moment except to create a functional small toy kernel and operating system. We are making up the details as we go along. WHAT COULD GO WRONG? :)
